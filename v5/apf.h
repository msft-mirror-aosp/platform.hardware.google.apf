/* A brief overview of APF:
 *
 * APF machine is composed of:
 *  1. A read-only program consisting of bytecodes as described below.
 *  2. Two 32-bit registers, called R0 and R1.
 *  3. Sixteen 32-bit temporary memory slots (cleared between packets).
 *  4. A read-only packet.
 *  5. An optional read-write transmit buffer.
 * The program is executed by the interpreter below and parses the packet
 * to determine if the application processor (AP) should be woken up to
 * handle the packet or if it can be dropped.  The program may also choose
 * to allocate/transmit/deallocate the transmit buffer.
 *
 * APF bytecode description:
 *
 * The APF interpreter uses big-endian byte order for loads from the packet
 * and for storing immediates in instructions.
 *
 * Each instruction starts with a byte composed of:
 *  Top 5 bits form "opcode" field, see *_OPCODE defines below.
 *  Next 2 bits form "size field", which indicates the length of an immediate
 *  value which follows the first byte.  Values in this field:
 *                 0 => immediate value is 0 and no bytes follow.
 *                 1 => immediate value is 1 byte big.
 *                 2 => immediate value is 2 bytes big.
 *                 3 => immediate value is 4 bytes big.
 *  Bottom bit forms "register" field, which (usually) indicates which register
 *  this instruction operates on.
 *
 *  There are four main categories of instructions:
 *  Load instructions
 *    These instructions load byte(s) of the packet into a register.
 *    They load either 1, 2 or 4 bytes, as determined by the "opcode" field.
 *    They load into the register specified by the "register" field.
 *    The immediate value that follows the first byte of the instruction is
 *    the byte offset from the beginning of the packet to load from.
 *    There are "indexing" loads which add the value in R1 to the byte offset
 *    to load from. The "opcode" field determines which loads are "indexing".
 *  Arithmetic instructions
 *    These instructions perform simple operations, like addition, on register
 *    values. The result of these instructions is always written into R0. One
 *    argument of the arithmetic operation is R0's value. The other argument
 *    of the arithmetic operation is determined by the "register" field:
 *            If the "register" field is 0 then the immediate value following
 *            the first byte of the instruction is used as the other argument
 *            to the arithmetic operation.
 *            If the "register" field is 1 then R1's value is used as the other
 *            argument to the arithmetic operation.
 *  Conditional jump instructions
 *    These instructions compare register R0's value with another value, and if
 *    the comparison succeeds, jump (i.e. adjust the program counter). The
 *    immediate value that follows the first byte of the instruction
 *    represents the jump target offset, i.e. the value added to the program
 *    counter if the comparison succeeds. The other value compared is
 *    determined by the "register" field:
 *            If the "register" field is 0 then another immediate value
 *            follows the jump target offset. This immediate value is of the
 *            same size as the jump target offset, and represents the value
 *            to compare against.
 *            If the "register" field is 1 then register R1's value is
 *            compared against.
 *    The type of comparison (e.g. equal to, greater than etc) is determined
 *    by the "opcode" field. The comparison interprets both values being
 *    compared as unsigned values.
 *  Miscellaneous instructions
 *    Instructions for:
 *      - allocating/transmitting/deallocating transmit buffer
 *      - building the transmit packet (copying bytes into it)
 *      - read/writing data section
 *
 *  Miscellaneous details:
 *
 *  Pre-filled temporary memory slot values
 *    When the APF program begins execution, six of the sixteen memory slots
 *    are pre-filled by the interpreter with values that may be useful for
 *    programs:
 *      #0 to #7 are zero initialized.
 *      Slot #8  is initialized with apf version (on APF >4).
 *      Slot #9  this is slot #15 with greater resolution (1/16384ths of a second)
 *      Slot #10 starts at zero, implicitly used as tx buffer output pointer.
 *      Slot #11 contains the size (in bytes) of the APF program.
 *      Slot #12 contains the total size of the APF program + data.
 *      Slot #13 is filled with the IPv4 header length. This value is calculated
 *               by loading the first byte of the IPv4 header and taking the
 *               bottom 4 bits and multiplying their value by 4. This value is
 *               set to zero if the first 4 bits after the link layer header are
 *               not 4, indicating not IPv4.
 *      Slot #14 is filled with size of the packet in bytes, including the
 *               ethernet link-layer header.
 *      Slot #15 is filled with the filter age in seconds. This is the number of
 *               seconds since the host installed the program. This may
 *               be used by filters that should have a particular lifetime. For
 *               example, it can be used to rate-limit particular packets to one
 *               every N seconds.
 *  Special jump targets:
 *    When an APF program executes a jump to the byte immediately after the last
 *      byte of the progam (i.e., one byte past the end of the program), this
 *      signals the program has completed and determined the packet should be
 *      passed to the AP.
 *    When an APF program executes a jump two bytes past the end of the program,
 *      this signals the program has completed and determined the packet should
 *      be dropped.
 *  Jump if byte sequence doesn't match:
 *    This is a special instruction to facilitate matching long sequences of
 *    bytes in the packet. Initially it is encoded like a conditional jump
 *    instruction with two exceptions:
 *      The first byte of the instruction is always followed by two immediate
 *        fields: The first immediate field is the jump target offset like other
 *        conditional jump instructions. The second immediate field specifies the
 *        number of bytes to compare.
 *      These two immediate fields are followed by a sequence of bytes. These
 *        bytes are compared with the bytes in the packet starting from the
 *        position specified by the value of the register specified by the
 *        "register" field of the instruction.
